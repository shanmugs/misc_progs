    "**Word2vec** is the first method we're going to explore to try to create that numeric representation. In the final chapter of this course, we'll compare all techniques to one another to understand where each one excels. Now to frame this, it's worth noting that word2vec stands for word to vector. So it will convert a word or a string of characters to a numeric vector. Let's start with a formal definition. *\"Word2vec is a shallow, two-layer neural network \"that accepts a text corpus as an input, \"and it returns a set of vectors, \"also known as embeddings; \"each vector is a numeric representation \"of a given word.\"* In practical terms, you would train this word2vec neural network on some very large corpus of text."
