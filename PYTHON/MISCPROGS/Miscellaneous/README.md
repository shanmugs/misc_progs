A collection of single old programs that I can not classify.



* Monty Hall Problem (2021, March, 31)\
  The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall. The problem was originally posed (and solved) in a letter by Steve Selvin to the American Statistician in 1975.
  
  Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?.

  The problem is a paradox of the veridical type, because the correct choice (that one should switch doors) is so counterintuitive it can seem absurd, but is nevertheless demonstrably true. The Monty Hall problem is mathematically closely related to the earlier Three Prisoners problem and to the much older Bertrand's box paradox.


* The Farm Problem (2020, November, 23)\
  It's a classical problem in linear optimization - Based in the class from Professor Luiz Leduino Neto (Unifesp): "Linear Optimization"
  
  Linear programming (LP, also called linear optimization) is a method to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a       mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships. Linear programming is a special case of mathematical programming (also known as mathematical optimization).

  John owns a small 45-hectare farm and wants to plant corn and beans. Each hectare of corn generates a profit of US $ 200 and each hectare of beans returns US $ 300 in profit. The number of employees and fertilizers needed for each hectare are described in the table below, Considering that John has 100 employees and 120 tons of fertilizers, how can he maximize his profit?
