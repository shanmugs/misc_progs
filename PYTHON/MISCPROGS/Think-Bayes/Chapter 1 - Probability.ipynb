    "\n",
    "**Theorem 1** gives us a way to compute a conditional probability using a conjunction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A~\\mathrm{and}~B)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem 2** gives us a way to compute a conjunction using a conditional probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A~\\mathrm{and}~B) = P(B) P(A|B)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem 3**, also known as Bayes's Theorem, gives us a way to get from $P(A|B)$ to $P(B|A)$, or the other way around:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A) P(B|A)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Law of Total Probability** provides a way to compute probabilities by adding up the pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A) = \\sum_i P(B_i) P(A|B_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
