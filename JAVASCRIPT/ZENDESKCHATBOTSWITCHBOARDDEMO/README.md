# Sunshine Switchboard Bot-Agent Handover Example

Don't forget to create a .env file with three values:
- SMOOCH_KEY_ID=\<API Key ID\>
- SMOOCH_KEY_SECRET=\<API Key Secret\>
- APP_ID=\<ID of Smooch App\>

All of these values can be found by going to [app.smooch.io](https://app.smooch.io), selecting the app, and clicking
 on **settings**. If you have not generated an API key, you may need to create one.
