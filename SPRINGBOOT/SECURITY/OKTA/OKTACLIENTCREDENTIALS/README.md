# OAuth 2.0 Client Credential With Spring Boot
 
This example app shows how to implement the client credentials grant with Spring Boot and Spring Security 5

Please read [OAuth 2.0 Client Credential With Spring Boot](https://developer.okta.com/blog/<need a link>) to see how this app was created.

**Prerequisites:** HTTPie, [Java 11](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) and an [Okta Developer Account](https://developer.okta.com).

> [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/) has Authentication and User Management APIs that reduce development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Okta's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage, and secure users and roles in any application.

> Java 11: This project uses Java 12. OpenJDK 12 will work just as well. Instructions are found on the [OpenJDK website](https://openjdk.java.net/install/). OpenJDK can also be installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Alternatively, [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) is another great option for installing and managing Java versions.

> HTTPie: This is a powerful command-line HTTP request utility that you'll use to test the WebFlux server. Install it according to [the docs on their site](https://httpie.org/doc#installation).

## Getting Started

The repository contains three sub-projects:
- `/secure-server` - a simple test server
- `/client-webclient` - a client built using the new WebClient
- `/client-resttemplate` - a client build using the deprecated RestTemplate

To run the sample app, the first step is to cofigure an Okta OIDC app for all three of the projects. Then, you can run the simple server (which has one endpoint at root). With the server running, you can run either or both of the clients. The clients demonstrate how to use the client credentials grant with Spring's WebClient and RestTemplate in Spring Security 5.

Before you begin, youâ€™ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com) and run `okta register` to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run `okta login`. 

Navigate a shell to the `/secure-server` sub-project. Run `okta apps create`. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit. Choose **4: Service (Machine-to-Machine)** and press **Enter**. Select **1: Okta Spring Boot Starter**.

The `secure-server/src/main/resources/application.properties` should look like the following (with you own values for the issuer, client ID, and client secret.
```properties
okta.oauth2.issuer=https\://{yourOktaUri}/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-secret=<yourClientSecret>
okta.oauth2.client-id={yourclientID}
```

Start the server. From the `secure-server` directory.
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The values above can be used to fill in the necessary values in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file in **both** of the client directories.

`src/main/resources/application.properties`
```properties
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-id={yourClientId}
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-secret={yourClientSecret}
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.authorization-grant-type=client_credentials
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.scope=mod_custom
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.okta.token-uri=https://{yourOktaUri}/oauth2/default/v1/token
spring.main.web-application-type=none
```

Open a shell and navigate to either of the client sub-project directories. Run the client.
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
