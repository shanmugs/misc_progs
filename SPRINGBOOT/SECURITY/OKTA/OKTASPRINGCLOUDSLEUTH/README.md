# Okta Spring Cloud Sleuth
 
This example app shows you how to use Spring Cloud Sleuth in a Spring Boot application secured with Okta and Okta's Spring Boot Starter.

Please read [FINAL TITLE HERE](https://<need.a.link>) to see how this app was created.

#### ^-- TODO: needs a link --^

**Prerequisites:** 

**Java 11**: This project uses Java 11. OpenJDK 11 will work just as well. Instructions are found on the [OpenJDK website](https://openjdk.java.net/install/). OpenJDK can also be installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Alternatively, [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) is another great option for installing and managing Java versions.

**Okta CLI**: Youâ€™ll be using Okta as an OAuth/OIDC provider to add JWT authentication and authorization to the application. You can go to [our developer site](https://developer.okta.com) to learn more about Okta. You need a free developer account for this tutorial. The Okta CLI is an easy way to register for a free Okta developer account, or log in to an existing one, and configure a Spring Boot app to use Okta as an auth provider. The [project GitHub page](https://github.com/okta/okta-cli) has installation instructions.

**HTTPie**: This is a powerful command-line HTTP request utility that you'll use to test the WebFlux server. Install it according to [the docs on their site](https://httpie.org/doc#installation).

> [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/) has Authentication and User Management APIs that reduce development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Okta's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage, and secure users and roles in any application.

## Getting Started

To install this example application, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://<need.a.link> spring-cloud-sleuth
cd spring-cloud-sleuth
```

This will get a copy of the project installed locally. Before the projects apps will run, however, you need to create an OIDC application in Okta and configure the application to use it.

## Create an Okta OIDC Application

The fastest way to do this is to use the Okta Maven Plugin, which will configure an OIDC application for you. Before you do this, you need to update the 
`application.properties` file (removing the three okta-related props - the plugin will put them back with the correct values).

`src/main/resources/application.properties`
```bash
spring.application.name=${APP_NAME}
server.port=${APP_PORT}
```
Then run the Okta Maven plugin.

```bash
mvn com.okta:okta-maven-plugin:setup
```

This places the necessary values in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file. 

If you created an OIDC application manually on the Okta website, instead of using the Maven plugin, make sure you put the necessary values in the `application.properties` file.

```yaml
okta.oauth2.issuer=https\://{yourOktaOrg}/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-secret={yourClientSecret}
okta.oauth2.client-id={yourClientId}
```

If you already have an Okta developer account and Okta Org, you can create a configuration file at `~/.okta/okta.yaml` for Okta Maven Plugin that will use that account.

`~/.okta/okta.yaml` 
```yml
okta:
  client:
    orgUrl: https://{yourOktaDomain}
    token: {yourApiToken}
```

You'll need to create an API token. From the Okta developer's console, go to **API** and **Tokens**. Click **Create Token**. Give the token a **name**. Copy the token value and place it in the `yaml` file along with your Okta domain.

If you do not have an Okta developer's account, don't worry about the `okta.yaml` file. The Okta Maven Plugin will configure it for you.

## Start the Apps

You will need to generate a JWT to test the application. To do this, you can use the [OIDC Debugger](https://oidcdebugger.com/). For full instructions, see the blog post associated with this project.

Once you have a token, store it in a shell variable and run a request using HTTPie.

```bash
TOKEN={your token value}
```

Start two instances of the application.

Service A:
```bash
APP_NAME="Service A" APP_PORT=8081 ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Service B:
```bash
APP_NAME="Service B" APP_PORT=8082 ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## Testing the Application

Make a request to service A endpoint `/a` using the JWT you just created.

```bash
http :8081/a "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

If all went well, you'll see this.

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 
...

Hello from /a - Service A, Hello from /b - Service B

```
