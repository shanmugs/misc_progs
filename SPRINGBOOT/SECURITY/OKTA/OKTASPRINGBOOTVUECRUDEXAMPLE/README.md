# Simple CRUD with Vue.js and Spring Boot
 
This example app shows how to build a basic CRUD app with Spring Boot 2.1, Spring Data, and Vue.js.

Please read [Build a Simple CRUD App with Spring Boot and Vue.js](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/11/20/build-crud-spring-and-vue) to see how this app was created.

**Prerequisites:** [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). 

> [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/) has Authentication and User Management APIs that reduce development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Okta's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage and secure users and roles in any application.

To run the server, cd into the `server` folder and run:
 
```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

To run the client, cd into the `client` folder and run:

```

### Create a New OIDC App in Okta

To create a new OIDC app on Okta:

1. Log in to your developer account, navigate to **Applications**, and click on **Add Application**.
3. Select **Single-Page App** and click **Next**. 
4. Give the application a name and click **Done**.

#### Server Configuration

Set your domain and copy the `clientId` into `server/src/main/resources/application.yml`. 

**NOTE:** The value of `{yourOktaDomain}` should be something like `dev-123456.oktapreview`. Make sure you don't include `-admin` in the value!

```yaml
okta:
  oauth2:
    client-id: {yourClientId}
    issuer: https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
```

#### Client Configuration

For the client, set the `issuer` and copy the `clientId` into `client/src/router.js`.

```js
Vue.use(Auth, {  
  issuer: 'https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default',  
  client_id: '{yourClientId}',  
  redirect_uri: window.location.origin + '/implicit/callback',  
  scope: 'openid profile email'  
});
```
