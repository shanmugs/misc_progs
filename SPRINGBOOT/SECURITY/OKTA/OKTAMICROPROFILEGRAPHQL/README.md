# MicroProfile REST API with JWT Auth

This repository shows how to create a GrapQL API with MicroProfile and use JWT for authentication. Please read <need a link!!!> to see how this example was created.

**Prerequisites:** 

- **Java 11**: [OpenJDK website](https://openjdk.java.net/install/). 
- **Maven**: Maven can be installed according to [the instructions on their website](https://maven.apache.org/install.html). You could also use  [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
- **Okta Developer Account**: Go to [our developer site](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) and sign up for a free developer account.
- **HTTPie**: Install it according to [the docs on their site](https://httpie.org/doc#installation).


> [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/) has Authentication and User Management APIs that reduce development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Okta's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage, and secure users and roles in any application.

## Getting Started

To install this example, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-microprofile-jwt-auth-example.git
cd okta-microprofile-jwt-auth-example
```

### Create an Application in Okta

Log in to your Okta Developer account (or [sign up](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) if you donâ€™t have an account).

1. From the **Applications** page, choose **Add Application**.
2. On the Create New Application page, select **Web**.
3. Give your app a memorable name, add `https://oidcdebugger.com/debug` as a Login redirect URI, check the box next to **Implicit (Hybrid)**, then click **Done**.

Modify `pom.xml` to use your Okta domain:

```xml
<properties>
  ...
  <oktaDomain>{yourOktaDomain}</oktaDomain>
</properties>
```

**NOTE:** The value of `{yourOktaDomain}` should be something like `dev-123456.okta.com`. Make sure you don't include `-admin` in the value!


Build your app and start the server:

```
mvn liberty:run
```

To generate a JWT access token, go to https://oidcdebugger.com/ and fill out the values for your OIDC application.

In a shell, store the token in a variable. Then use it to hit the API and authentication with JWT:

```
http POST :9080/graphql query='{ surfReport(location:"Texas") {windKnots,swellHeight,swellPeriodSeconds} }' "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
